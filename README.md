# FFXCutsceneRemover
Cutscene skipping program for the Windows Steam version of Final Fantasy X HD Remaster.
If you encounter any bugs or have any questions, please open an issue on GitHub or contact us on the [FFX Speedrun Discord](https://discord.gg/X3qXHWG).

### Important

* This mod is designed and tested to be used for speedruns only. Using this mod for normal playthroughs is not supported, and the unexpected behaviour may cause game-breaking bugs. If you use this mod for normal playthroughs, it is strongly recommended to manually save regularly and not rely on auto-saves.

* This mod currently only works on Windows using the Steam release of FFX.

### Usage:

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page here](https://github.com/erickt420/FFXCutsceneRemover/releases).

2. Launch FFXCutsceneRemove.exe.

3. Launch Final Fantasy X.

The order in which you launch the mod and the game does not matter.
You do not need to start a new game in order to gain the effects of the mod, however, if you start from a save file you may find that it takes a while before the cutscenes start skipping.

### Arguments:
You can use multiple arguments by separating them with a space.
- enable debug:  
`FFXCutsceneRemover.exe true`
- change the amount of milliseconds the program sleeps between polling iterations:  
`FFXCutsceneRemover.exe 50`
